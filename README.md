## Development instructions 

1. Import to your favourite IDE
2. Run main method of the Server class to launch embedded web server that lists all your test UIs at http://localhost:9998
3. Code and test
  * create UI's for various use cases for your add-ons, see examples. These can also work as usage examples for your add-on users.
  * create browser level and integration tests under src/test/java/
  * Browser level tests are executed manually from IDE (JUnit case) or with Maven profile "browsertests" (mvn verify -Pbrowsertests). If you have a setup for solidly working Selenium driver(s), consider enabling that profile by default.
4. Test also in real world projects, on good real integration test is to *create a separate demo project* using vaadin-archetype-application, build a snapshot release ("mvn install") of the add-on and use the snapshot build in it. Note, that you can save this demo project next to your add-on project and save it to same GIT(or some else SCM) repository, just keep them separated for perfect testing.


## GWT related stuff

* To recompile test widgetset, issue *mvn vaadin:compile*, if you think the widgetset changes are not picked up by Vaadin plugin, do a *mvn clean package* or try with parameter *mvn vaadin:compile -Dgwt.compiler.force=true*
* To use superdevmode, issue "mvn vaadin:run-codeserver" and then just open superdevmode like with any other project

## Creating releases

1. Push your changes to e.g. Github 
2. Update pom.xml to contain proper SCM coordinates (first time only)
3. Use Maven release plugin (mvn release:prepare; mvn release:perform)
4. Upload the ZIP file generated to target/checkout/target directory to https://vaadin.com/directory service (and/or optionally publish your add-on to Maven central)
